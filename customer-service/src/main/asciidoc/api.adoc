[[overview]]
= Overview

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP Verbs
The `Customer API` tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP verbs.
|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve one or more resources

| `POST`
| Used to create a resource

|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP Status Codes
|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| Standard response for successful HTTP requests. +
The actual response will depend on the request method used. +
In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource. +

| `201 Created`
| The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.

| `400 Bad Request`
| The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message or parameter).

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.

| `422 Unprocessable Entity`
| Means the server understands the content type of the request entity, and the syntax of the request entity is correct, +
but was unable to process the contained instructions. +
For example, this error condition may occur if an JSON request body contains well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), +
but semantically erroneous, JSON content.

| `5xx Server Error`
|  Indicate cases in which the server is aware that it has encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the request.

This API is built in http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot]. To make Ops work easier we put together some +
production ready endpoints from https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html[Spring Boot Actuator].
